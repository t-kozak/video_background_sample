  The king of this show - the video tag. Couple of notes:
  - the video must be muted in order to be autoplayed. If you don't add the "muted" attribute
    even if the video does not contain audio track, browser will not autoplay it with error 
    "I don't want to bother my dear human with the noise of your crappy video. You want to play 
    the clip make sure that human presses the play button" or so.
  - the poster we're using is just a transparent gif. This technique allows us to dynamically
    select the backround poster - either for portrait or landscape video clip. See style.css,
    specifically ".hero-bg video" sections for more context
-->
      <video muted loop playsinline
        poster="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7">

        <!-- 
    We're providing the browser with 3 sources and let it pick the preferred one. We have 
    videos encoded with HEVC, VP9 and AVC respectively. 
    
    Each video source tag does not specify the source directly, but instead uses "data-src" 
    and "data-portrait-src". This allows us  to first defer fetching of the videos until all 
    of the page is loaded (poster will be displayed until it happens). 
    
    It also makes it possible to select a video files with correct orientation (portrait and 
    landscape).
    
    Final important thing to note is the use of codecs="hvc1" parameter of the first source 
    type. This clarification is necessary as by default browsers assume video/mp4 is video 
    file encoded with AVC rather than HEVC. In result browsers/platforms not supporting HEVC 
    playback (e.g. Chrome) will try to play the file and fail miserabely. 

    See the loader.js for more on how the video files are loaded and played

        <source data-src="assets/bg_vp9.webm" data-portrait-src="assets/bg_portrait_vp9.webm" type="video/webm" />
        <source data-src="assets/bg_avc.mp4" data-portrait-src="assets/bg_portrait_avc.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
